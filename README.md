# <module-1-challange>

## Description

In this challenge, I undertook the task of refactoring both the HTML code and the style.css file. In the HTML file, I made significant improvements to enhance accessibility for individuals who may face challenges when viewing a webpage, such as those with visual impairments or color blindness. These improvements involved modifying accessibility tags and incorporating semantic tags to improve the overall structure and clarity of the code.

Additionally, in the style.css file, I streamlined the code by consolidating similar styles into a single class, effectively reducing redundancy and eliminating unnecessary lines of code. To enhance transparency and facilitate review, I also inserted comments throughout the code, providing clear explanations of the changes I made. These comments serve as valuable documentation for anyone reviewing the code in the future.

## Installation

I used visual studio code to refactor the codes then uploaded it using the github webpage.
